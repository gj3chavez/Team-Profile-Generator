## Description
   As a developer, I want a Profile generator which quickly enables you to create a professional Profile for a new project.  
   This project is based in a node.js application that accepts user input from inquirer. 
   The app starts with a welcome message. Then the user is presented with a set of questions and choices that requiere their input. 
   After choosing a license, the respective license badge will be at the top of the Readme.
